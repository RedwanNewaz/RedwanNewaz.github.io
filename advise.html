            <h2><em><code>Research Focus and Mission</code></em></h2>
          </header>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The AiR Lab at UNO is dedicated to
            developing software for highly autonomous unmanned vehicles that can
            operate in air, ground, and water. Our mission is to create robots
            capable of operating independently without human supervision,
            carrying out complex missions over long distances and time periods,
            and collaborating seamlessly with human partners.</p>

            <h2><em><code>Research Approach</code></em></h2>
          </header>
          <p style="text-align: left;">In our group, the prime directive for
            graduate students is to focus on the most interesting and impactful
            research questions. When addressing autonomy research, we strive to
            identify capabilities robots currently lack, explain technical gaps
            that existed prior to the research, and uncover underlying
            principles that can be applied broadly.</p>

            <h2><em>Advisor's Role</em></h2>
          </header>
          <p style="text-align: left;">As an advisor, my primary
            responsibilities include helping students identify research
            questions, framing technical questions, and guiding students on the
            path to answering these questions. I work closely with each student
            to ensure they are well-equipped to tackle the challenges in their
            research.</p>

            <h2><em>Student Expectations</em></h2>
          </header>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Students in the AiR Lab are expected to
            follow the research path set out for them, execute technical
            development, and communicate their insights to the community. I
            encourage lab attendance at least three times per week and aim for
            students to publish a novel conference paper annually on average,
            although this is not a strict requirement as research often requires
            patience.</p>

            <h2><em>Emphasis on Writing and Software Development</em></h2>
          </header>
          <p style="text-align: left;">I place significant importance on the
            writing process, engaging substantially with students in writing and
            revising papers to produce the best possible work. Additionally, I
            consider software development as a crucial part of training,
            ensuring that students' software remains useful and relevant after
            they complete their degrees.</p>

            <h2><em>Lab Structure and Collaboration</em></h2>
          </header>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The AiR Lab typically consists of 2-6
            students. Our structure includes weekly one-on-one meetings with
            each student and weekly group meetings, which I consider the most
            important meeting of the week. These group meetings provide
            opportunities for collaborative learning and engagement. I strongly
            encourage collaboration within the group and with other research
            groups, as I believe research in autonomous robots is a team sport.</p>

            <h2><em>Equity and Inclusion</em></h2>
          </header>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Equity and inclusion are crucial aspects
            of our lab culture. I view students as research partners and strive
            to never ask someone to do a task I wouldn't be willing to do
            myself. All team members are expected to share responsibilities,
            with senior students mentoring junior students and junior students
            contributing to the community from day one. I actively welcome
            researchers of all identities and support creating a space for lab
            members to raise and discuss relevant DEI topics in robotics</p>

            <h2><em>Career Preparation</em></h2>
          </header>
          <p style="text-align: left;">I am committed to supporting students in
            preparing for their chosen career paths. Whether a student is
            interested in academia or industry, I work with them to prepare
            academic research statements, job talks, or industrial applications
            as needed. I recognize that these paths are not mutually exclusive
            and strive to provide comprehensive support for various career
            trajectories.</p>
